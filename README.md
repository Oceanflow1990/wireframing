## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes are essential tools in the design process, as they provide a visual blueprint of a digital product. Below are the key elements typically found in a wireframe and how they contribute to the overall design:

### 1. Layout Structure
- **Description:** Defines the basic framework of the page, including spacing, columns, and the arrangement of elements.
- **Example Contribution:** A two-column layout might separate navigation on the left from main content on the right, ensuring a clean and organized structure.

### 2. Navigation
- **Description:** Shows how users will move through the interface, often represented by menus, sidebars, or tabs.
- **Example Contribution:** A top navigation bar with links to *Home*, *Bookings*, and *Profile* helps users quickly understand how to access different parts of a booking system.

### 3. Content Placement
- **Description:** Indicates where text, images, videos, or interactive elements will appear on the page.
- **Example Contribution:** Placing a hero image and search bar at the top of a travel booking site draws attention immediately to the search functionality, guiding user action.

### 4. Functionality
- **Description:** Highlights interactive components such as buttons, forms, and input fields that allow users to perform actions.
- **Example Contribution:** A “Book Now” button under each listed tour package clearly signals the action users can take, improving usability and conversions.
