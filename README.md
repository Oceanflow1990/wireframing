## Key Elements of a Wireframe

Wireframes are essential tools in the design process, as they provide a visual blueprint of a digital product. Below are the key elements typically found in a wireframe and how they contribute to the overall design:

### 1. Layout Structure
- **Description:** Defines the basic framework of the page, including spacing, columns, and the arrangement of elements.
- **Example Contribution:** A two-column layout might separate navigation on the left from main content on the right, ensuring a clean and organized structure.

### 2. Navigation
- **Description:** Shows how users will move through the interface, often represented by menus, sidebars, or tabs.
- **Example Contribution:** A top navigation bar with links to *Home*, *Bookings*, and *Profile* helps users quickly understand how to access different parts of a booking system.

### 3. Content Placement
- **Description:** Indicates where text, images, videos, or interactive elements will appear on the page.
- **Example Contribution:** Placing a hero image and search bar at the top of a travel booking site draws attention immediately to the search functionality, guiding user action.

### 4. Functionality
- **Description:** Highlights interactive components such as buttons, forms, and input fields that allow users to perform actions.
- **Example Contribution:** A “Book Now” button under each listed tour package clearly signals the action users can take, improving usability and conversions.

## Types of Wireframes

Wireframes come in different levels of detail, depending on the stage of the design process. The two most common types are **Low-Fidelity Wireframes** and **High-Fidelity Wireframes**.

### Low-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Description:** Simple sketches or outlines that focus on structure and layout rather than visual design.  
- **Usage:** Used early in the design process to brainstorm ideas, map user flows, and gather feedback without investing too much time in details.  
- **Example:** A hand-drawn sketch or a simple digital outline with boxes representing text and images.

### High-Fidelity Wireframes
- **Description:** More detailed representations that include typography, spacing, colors, and sometimes real content. They closely resemble the final product.  
- **Usage:** Used later in the design process to refine usability, demonstrate interactions, and prepare for prototyping and development.  
- **Example:** A polished digital wireframe created in tools like Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD that shows exact font sizes, colors, and content layout.

## Identifying the Wireframe Type in This Project

The wireframe used in this project is a **Low-Fidelity Wireframe**.  
- It emphasizes **layout structure, navigation flow, and content placement** rather than visual styling.  
- This makes it suitable for **early-stage design discussions**, where the goal is to validate functionality and user experience before adding detailed design elements.

| Type                  | Description | Usage | Example |
|-----------------------|-------------|-------|---------|
| **Low-Fidelity**      | Simple sketches or outlines focusing on structure and layout rather than visual design. | Early in the design process to brainstorm ideas, map user flows, and gather quick feedback. | Hand-drawn sketches or simple digital outlines with placeholder boxes. |
| **High-Fidelity**     | Detailed representations including typography, spacing, colors, and sometimes real content. Closely resembles the final product. | Later in the design process to refine usability, demonstrate interactions, and prepare for development. | Polished digital wireframes created in Figma, Sketch, or Adobe XD. |
